# About project

These are the project data used to create and generate my classic Adobe Animate test videos of snowboarding animation. I spent extra time on this in class and got a good grade, although I consider it now to be a overly basic project, but still good for my first animation in Adobe Animate.

Created using: `Adobe Animate CC 2018 (education edition)` (education edition just means it was done on a school computer, so it probably uses some school oriented version of the software. I hope it is viewable in non-Adobe software, as I have come to dislike Adobes software due to its price, DRM, proprietary aspects, and denial of Linux support.

## Video

Currently, I don't have the exported video on me, and I can't upload it here anyway, as I know it greatly exceeds GitHubs 25 mebibyte fle limit.

### Duration

I don't remember the duration of this animation at the moment, but I know it is at least 25 seconds long (and a maximum of 2 minutes long)
