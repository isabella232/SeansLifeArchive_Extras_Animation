# About assets

These are the assets used to create and generate my classic Adobe Animate test videos of snowboarding animation. I spent extra time on this in class and got a good grade, although I consider it now to be a overly basic project, but still good for my first animation in Adobe Animate.

This animation is done via frame-by-frame. I hope that it is viewable and exportable through non-Adobe software.

## Duration

I don't remember the duration of this animation at the moment, but I know it is at least 25 seconds long (and a maximum of 2 minutes long)
